# Employee-database
Your Task
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your challenge this week is to build a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

ON THE JOB
Throughout this module, you've used SQLite for the project and MySQL in the virtual classes. You'll also use MySQL for this Challenge.

You might be wondering why you're using two different types of SQL. To be employer-competitive, it's important to have some exposure to more than one variant of SQL. There are minor differences among the variants, but everything you've learned about one type of SQL can be applied to others.

Working with MySQL in the virtual classes has prepared you for the Challenge. Furthermore, making the connection between that and what you've learned in the lessons will help you practice an important skill that all developers need to succeed, known as the generation effect.

The generation effect requires you to solve something you're less familiar with by pulling in related knowledge that you already have to fill in the gaps in your understanding. This process creates a strong connection between the new content and the existing knowledge. In the end, this will make you a more competitive job candidate and leave you better prepared for your first developer role!

User Story
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employee’s first name, last name, role, and manager and that employee is added to the database
WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database 
Mock-Up
The following animation shows an example of the application being used from the command line:

A user accesses the employee database through the command line, viewing employee names and adding a new employee.

Getting Started
You’ll need to use the MySQL2 package (Links to an external site.) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, the Inquirer package (Links to an external site.) to interact with the user via the command-line, and the console.table package (Links to an external site.) to print MySQL rows to the console.

You might also want to make your queries asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a .promise() function on Connections to “upgrade” an existing non-Promise connection to use Promises. Look into MySQL2's documentation (Links to an external site.) to make your queries asynchronous.

Design the database schema as shown in the following image:

Database schema includes tables labeled “employee,” role,” and “department.”

As the image illustrates, your schema should contain the following three tables:

Department

id: INT PRIMARY KEY

name: VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

Role

id: INT PRIMARY KEY

title: VARCHAR(30) to hold role title

salary: DECIMAL to hold role salary

department_id: INT to hold reference to department role belongs to

Employee

id: INT PRIMARY KEY

first_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name

last_name: VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name

role_id: INT to hold reference to employee role

manager_id: INT to hold reference to another employee that is manager of the current employee. This field may be null if the employee has no manager.

You may want to use a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these. You may also want to include a seeds.sql file to pre-populate your database. This will make the development of individual features much easier.

Bonus
See if you can add some additional functionality to your application, such as the ability to:

Update employee managers.

View employees by manager.

View employees by department.

Delete departments, roles, and employees.

View the total utilized budget of a department—i.e., the combined salaries of all employees in that department.

Grading Requirements
